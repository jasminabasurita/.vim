# Jazzy's NeoVimrc
Hi, I'm Jazzy! 
  I :heart: nerding out about NeoVim and customizing the editor!

| Packages I Use:                 |                                                    How I feel about them |
| ------------------------------- | -----------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Vundle.vim                      |                                        Makes Plugin Management a Breeze! |
| nerdtree.git                    |                                                   Absolutely **Crucial** |
| vim-multiple-cursors            |         Great for beginners to vim, but native vim features do it better |
| YouCompleteMe                   | So Helpful, keeps track of paths,   variable names and built in functions! |
| auto-pairs                      |                        closes brackets and quotes! what's not to love?!? |
| vim-commentary                  |                                       Comment things out quick and easy! |
| vim-dracula                     |                                                     Clean & simple theme |
| vim-javascript                  |                                          JavaScript Syntax Highlighting! |
| vim-javascript-syntax           |                                                more syntax highlighting! |
| vim-jsx                         |                                               React syntax highlighting! |
| javascript-libraries-syntax.vim |                                       I clearly like syntax highlighting |
| JavaScript-Indent               |                                                       Better Indentation |
| ale                             |     **I** _Love_ ALE. lints and fixes! asynchronous! _Essential_ package |
| vim-airline                     |                                      Makes me feel like a real developer |
| vim-airline-themes              |                                       What's vim-airline without themes? |
| vim-fugitive                    |                                              very featureful git wrapper |
| vim-gitgutter                   |                                          helps keep track of git changes |
| vim-json                        |                                       makes json files look so so pretty |
| jspc.vim                        |                                         keep track of recurring strings! |
| vim-surround                    |                    Again, I love not having to type both brackets myself |
